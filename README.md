## MASSE (Multi-Agent System Simulation Environment)
MASSE is a simulation framework designed for consensus algorithms and diverse dynamical agents (dynamic systems). The current implementation features P- and PID-controlled agents, with plans for expansion to include additional agent types and consensus algorithms in future iterations.

This project was developed during my tenure in the Autonomous Systems program at the Technical University of Darmstadt.

Key Features:
- Versatile Agent Models: Supports P- and PID-controlled agents.
- Modular Architecture: Easily integrates new agent models and algorithms.
- Visualization: Includes functions like visualize_step for interactive visualization of agent positions.

Purpose:
MASSE provides researchers and developers with a robust platform for exploring complex multi-agent interactions and control strategies. Its modular architecture allows for seamless integration of new agent models and algorithms, making it suitable for both academic research and practical applications in the field of autonomous systems.
